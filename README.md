An incomplete LaiNES fork to Vita. It's extremely slow due to audio and CPU not being threaded. Controls may or may not work.

Kudos to **Rufis_**, **cuevavirus**, **CreepNT**, **skyl4nk**, **Princess of Sleeping** and **dots-tb** for their help getting this to run.

Needs **fnblit** to build, you can use **ddpm** from **DolceSDK** to install it.

**Original LaiNES contributors**
Andrea Orru - LaiNES
Jeff Katz - Mapper 002 & 003, configuration.
PudgeMa - Scrollable menu and bug fixes.
